# Book Review Community üìö
A web platform designed for book enthusiasts to search, review, and discuss their favorite books. This community-driven platform allows users to share insights, discover new reads, and connect with fellow book lovers.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library

## Features ‚ú®
- **Search for Books**: Easily find books by title, author, or genre.
- **Write Reviews**: Share your thoughts and ratings on books you've read.
- **Discussion Forums**: Engage with other users in discussions about various books and genres.
- **User Profiles**: Create and customize your profile to showcase your reading history and preferences.
- **Bookmark Books**: Save books to your reading list for later.
- **Follow Users**: Stay updated on reviews and recommendations from your favorite users.

## Installation & Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-review-community.git
   cd book-review-community
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` üöÄ
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` üß™
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` üì¶
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject` ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Backend Setup üñ•Ô∏è
If your project has a backend, navigate to the backend directory and set it up:

```sh
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Ensure you configure your `.env` file for the backend properly. Additionally, refer to the API documentation for details on available endpoints and usage.

## Learn More üìñ
You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Backend Deployment üöÄ
To deploy your backend, consider using services like **Render, Railway, or AWS**.

## Frontend Deployment üåê
To build and deploy the frontend application:

```sh
npm run build
```
Upload the contents of the `build` folder to a static hosting provider like **Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3**.

### `npm run build` fails to minify

## Environment Variables Setup üåç

This project uses environment variables for configuration. Instead of hardcoding sensitive information, follow these steps:

### Client (Frontend)
1. Navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to create your own `.env` file:
   ```sh
   cp client/.env.example client/.env
   ```
3. Fill in the necessary values inside `client/.env`.

### Server (Backend)
1. Navigate to the `server` directory.
2. Copy the `.env.example` file:
   ```sh
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   ```
3. Fill in the required values inside `server/.env`.

**Note:** The `.env` files are ignored by Git, so make sure not to commit them.
